# About Me

Senior Computer Science student focusing on reverse engineering Apple firmware.

## What I want to do on this blog
- Document and display my reverse engineering process, and findings.
- Explore various stacks related to the iOS/macOS kernel and it's connection to userspace accessible code paths.
- Hopefully post some cool bugs to share :)


No fluff :P Just technical content and research results.
